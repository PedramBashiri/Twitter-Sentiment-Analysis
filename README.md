# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
A big data project with Hadoop in which I utilized MapReduce and HDFS to do a sentiment analysis on 30,000 tweets to determine how people like android 5. I used D3.js to visualize the result, it could be found at http://tomcat-unccrruparel.rhcloud.com/TweetOnDroid.
Here are the two java projects that run independently of the Hadoop and HBase part. It actually prepares the data that codes on hadoop uses later.
